Hey there! My name is Shai Geva.

&nbsp;

I've been writing code for over 20 years, and I remain optimistic about our ability
to create stuff that work and are not too complex to maintain.

&nbsp;

I write about code, tests (a lot), ai and other stuff (noting - the site is new so not all posts have been uploaded yet,
they will be added in the next few weeks) .

&nbsp;

Look around, and ping me on social to tell me if you found something useful!
