My name is Shai Geva.

I've been creating software for humans, with humans, for over 20 years.

I'm mostly a builder, but have also played more "high level roles", like product and management (my current position is
tech-lead at [Sayata](https://www.sayata.com/ "Sayata home page")).


I [write about]({{< ref "/posts/" >}}) various topics, focusing on AI, code quality and automated tests - all of which
I'm very passionate about.

I also [speak at confrences]({{< ref "/talks" >}}), so far exclusively about tests.
