      <title>10 Ways To Shoot Yourself In The Foot With Tests</title>
      <link>https://shaigeva.com/posts/10_footguns/ten_footguns/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a series of posts, following a talk I gave (twice - at Pycon-US 2023 and Pycon-IL 2024), about testing best (and not-so-best) practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk shares 10 practices that I had bad experience with, along with ways of avoiding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main objective of the post series is to help you write tests that have a better ROI.&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss different practices, different ways that we can work.&lt;br&gt;
These practices affect us by changing the properties of our tests:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Footgun #8 - Test Doubles Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://shaigeva.com/posts/10_footguns/08_test_doubles_everywhere/</link>

      <description>&lt;span class=&#34;aside&#34;&gt;
This mini-post is part of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://shaigeva.com/posts/10_footguns/ten_footguns&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; about good testing practices, which I also presented at a couple of conferences.
&lt;br&gt;
Here it is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Ub31Ae6S1BY?t=837&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PyCon US 2023&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, in a test, we switch a part of the system, a dependency, with an alternative implementation.&lt;br&gt;
These are called test doubles. Things like stubs, mocks and fakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of the central reasons for doing this are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance - if the real thing is too slow to run a lot of tests, we switch it with a
fast test double.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control - it might be difficult or impossible to set up the real thing in a certain state or make it behave in a
certain way.  Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s non-deterministic, maybe it has side effects that are not acceptable in tests. But tests
doubles are under our full control and won&amp;rsquo;t create side effects we don&amp;rsquo;t want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-problem-with-test-doubles&#34;&gt;The problem with test doubles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test doubles can be useful, but they are a re-implementation.&lt;br&gt;
They know the implementation details of the thing they&amp;rsquo;re replacing.&lt;br&gt;
Different types of test doubles do it differently, but this is what they do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Footgun #7 - Improper Test Scope</title>
      <link>https://shaigeva.com/posts/10_footguns/07_improper_test_scope/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 10:16:56 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shaigeva.com/posts/10_footguns/07_improper_test_scope/</guid>
      <description>&lt;span class=&#34;aside&#34;&gt;
This mini-post is part of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://shaigeva.com/posts/10_footguns/ten_footguns&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; about good testing practices, which I also presented at a couple of conferences.
&lt;br&gt;
Here it is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Ub31Ae6S1BY?t=447&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PyCon US 2023&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root cause of many testing problems is improper test scope, i.e. that their boundaries aren&amp;rsquo;t appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;test-a-cohesive-whole---complete-story&#34;&gt;Test a cohesive whole - complete story&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach here is that a test should verify a cohesive whole, a &amp;ldquo;complete story&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;
It can be a large story like an e2e test or a small story that&amp;rsquo;s part of a bigger story, like a custom sorting function
that something else uses.&lt;br&gt;
As long as it&amp;rsquo;s something self-contained - something whole, it might be worth testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Footgun #6 - Testing Too Many Things</title>
      <link>https://shaigeva.com/posts/10_footguns/06_testing_too_many_things/</link>

      <description>&lt;style&gt;
.code-example {
  background-color: #2E2E33;
  padding: 10px;
  margin-bottom:10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  font-family: monospace;
  white-space: pre;
  color: #d5d5d6;
  font-size: .78em;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
.highlight-red {
  color: red;
}
.highlight-green {
  color: green;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

Here it is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Ub31Ae6S1BY?t=177&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PyCon US 2023&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like with product code, if we put too many things in the same place we get a mess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Footgun #4 - No Locality of Behavior</title>
      <link>https://shaigeva.com/posts/10_footguns/04_no_locality_of_behavior/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 20:15:56 +0300</pubDate>

This mini-post is part of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://shaigeva.com/posts/10_footguns/ten_footguns&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; about good testing practices, which I also presented at a couple of conferences.
&lt;br&gt;
Here it is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Ub31Ae6S1BY?t=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PyCon US 2023&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One testing problem that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get enough attention in my opinion is tests that don&amp;rsquo;t have locality of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that I mean cases where a test is broken down into different parts in a way that makes understanding more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important in every type of code, and tests are no exception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Footgun #3 - The Tests Are Not Isolated</title>
      <link>https://shaigeva.com/posts/10_footguns/03_the_tests_are_not_isolated/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 20:15:56 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shaigeva.com/posts/10_footguns/03_the_tests_are_not_isolated/</guid>
      <description>&lt;span class=&#34;aside&#34;&gt;
This mini-post is part of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://shaigeva.com/posts/10_footguns/ten_footguns&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; about good testing practices, which I also presented at a couple of conferences.
&lt;br&gt;
Here it is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Ub31Ae6S1BY?t=412&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PyCon US 2023&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing tests that are not isolated is a sure way to create unnecessary work for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &amp;ldquo;tests that are not isolated&amp;rdquo;, I mean tests that sometimes have a different outcome (failing / passing) if we run
only a subset of them, if we run them in a different order or if we run them in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
