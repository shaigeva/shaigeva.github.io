<p>The main reason I think this needs to happen is that any way I look at it, our current methods will simply make it very
hard to implement some of the most important improvements that are coming.<br>
And since the productivity boosts are so significant - I believe it&rsquo;ll happen.</p>
<p>In this series of posts, I will try to show in detail why I believe this and what kind of changes we can expect.<br>
I&rsquo;ll start with some of the high-level of are some of the limitations of our current methods,
and then dive into concrete, low-level examples: showing how something would be difficult for AI on general, and how
we can make it substantially easier by enforcing specific solutions.<br>
I&rsquo;ll try to set up POCs to show that things are realistic in places where it&rsquo;s more difficult to see (I&rsquo;m not planning
actual implementation of a framework or engine).</p>
<p>NOTE: MAYBE say something about how a standard way to approach difficult problems is both to find a direct solution, and
to redesign the problem.</p>
<p>The approaches we&rsquo;ll explore are all existing industry techniques, though I&rsquo;m not aware of them being applied in an organized way to the general problem of programming with AI.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about design, tests, error handling, system architecture, random algorithms,
