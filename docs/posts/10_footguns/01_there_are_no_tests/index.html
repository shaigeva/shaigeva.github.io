<p>This is a &ldquo;warm-up footgun&rdquo; to the blog post series.</p>
<p>The easiest way to shoot yourself in the foot, testing-wise, is to have no tests at all.</p>
<p>In my experience, writing any tests often helps us - even if these tests are not well-written, and even if they&rsquo;re just a drop in the sea.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I noticed, why moving from no tests at all to even one test for some area of the code is useful.</p>
<h3 id="code-changes-around-hotspots">Code changes around hotspots<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#code-changes-around-hotspots">#</a></h3>
<p>Code changes are not uniformly distributed.</p>
<p>If we have a signifcantly-sized code base and we look 6 months to the past, we will see that changes tend to happen in the same places. We don&rsquo;t change all types of features all the time and all types of infrastructure all the time.<br>
Features tend to evolve iteratively, and bugs that are introduced are statistically fixed in the following weeks or months.</p>
<p>So chances are - if you&rsquo;ve changed an area of the code today, you will change it again in the next month.</p>
<p>For automated tests, what this means is that adding tests for the code we&rsquo;re working on now tends to have a much larger impact than we might assume, because they are likely to protect us in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>But once we have a single test, we have an initial &ldquo;paved road&rdquo;, and we can keep improving in iterative steps, which is far easier.</p>

<p>Maybe the first test you&rsquo;re writing will be the last.<br>
