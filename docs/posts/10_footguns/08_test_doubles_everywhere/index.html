Sometimes, in a test, we switch a part of the system, a dependency, with an alternative implementation.
These are called test doubles. Things like stubs, mocks and fakes.
The main reason we use them is performance - if the real thing is too slow to run a lot of tests, we switch it with a fast test double.

And this gives us some real world certainty.\nThe essence of the idea is to use test doubles, but selectively verify their correctness until we get an acceptable tradeoff.\nAnother way to “use test doubles and verify” is by caching recordings. We can record HTTP requests, DB actions, or anything else.\nFor example, at CodiumAI, We have an HTTP service that calls another HTTP service - an AI layer that does code analysis and generation.\nSo, in our tests, we record and save the HTTP interactions between the main server and the AI server.\nLocally, we run the tests against the recordings, so they are very fast.\nBut - we also verify. In the cloud, we also run the tests against the real thing to make sure they are still valid.\nConclusion ",
