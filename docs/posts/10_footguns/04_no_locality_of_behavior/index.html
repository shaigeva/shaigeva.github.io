<p>One testing problem that doesn&rsquo;t get enough attention in my opinion is tests that don&rsquo;t have locality of behavior.</p>
<p>By that I mean cases where a test is broken down into different parts in a way that makes understanding more difficult.</p>
<p>This is important in every type of code, and tests are no exception.</p>
<h2 id="example-non-local-data">Example: non-local data<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#example-non-local-data">#</a></h2>
<p>Consider this test:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">test_something</span>():
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    data <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Path(PATH_TO_DATA_FILE)<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>read_text()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">assert</span> calc_something(data) <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4.5</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The data that the test uses is in a different file, so in order to understand the test we will need to locate that file
and open it.<br>
Even if the data was in the same file, but a different place - it would still be an issue.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes we don&rsquo;t have a choice, and it&rsquo;s the only way to do it.<br>
But sometimes we do.</p>
<p>For example, if we can find a data example that&rsquo;s small enough, we can do something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">test_something</span>():
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    data <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">“””</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>{
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span>JSON data<span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">“””</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">assert</span> calc_something(data) <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4.5</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is exactly the same test, but the data is local so it&rsquo;s going to be much easier to understand at a glance, without
&ldquo;breaking the flow&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="its-easier-in-tests-than-in-production-code">It&rsquo;s easier in tests than in production code<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#its-easier-in-tests-than-in-production-code">#</a></h2>
<p>One of the main problems with achieving locality of behavior is that it conflicts with DRY (&ldquo;don&rsquo;t repeat yourself&rdquo;).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the problem with code duplication in production code?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll often hear people talking about the &ldquo;economics&rdquo; - if you repeat a piece of code 3 times, then if you need to change that logic, you would need to do that work 3 times.<br>
However, this is actually a secondary consideration, especially if the number of repetitions is not high (let&rsquo;s say 5 or less).<br>
The real issue with repeating yourself is that duplication is an implicit dependency.<br>
If you repeat the same logic in 3 different places, there&rsquo;s a risk that if the logic needs to change, you would not notice one of these places, which would cause that &ldquo;usage&rdquo; to be deprecated and incosistent with the rest of the code - which will result in bugs and maintainability overhead, of course.</p>
<p>The nice thing about tests here is that this consideration is weaker, because of several factors.</p>
<ol>
<li>When we change code that has a test and make it behave differently, the relevant tests will usually break, so we will have something that points out to the duplicated &ldquo;usages&rdquo;. Where in production code - we only get that benefit if that piece of code has relevant tests - which might be very far from &ldquo;always&rdquo;.</li>
<li>If the tests are focused and verify only a single fact, the number of times that we have duplication will be lower. And it&rsquo;s far easier to write a test (at least a test that&rsquo;s not end-to-end) that &ldquo;checks one thing&rdquo; than it is to write code that &ldquo;does a single thing&rdquo;, because if a piece of code does multiple things - you can just write multiple tests that run it separately, and each of them would test one thing.</li>
<li>And, finally, if the mistake does happen in test-code and we forget to update a &ldquo;usage&rdquo; - it&rsquo;ll render the test &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;, but it won&rsquo;t actually cause a bug. Making a test wrong is bad, but it&rsquo;s not as bad as a production bug, unless it affects a lot of tests.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, duplication is still something to consider - if there&rsquo;s complex setup, or something that&rsquo;s not complex but repeats many times - it&rsquo;s probably worth it to extract functionality.<br>
The point is that in production code, the right time to extract functionality is often after two or three usages - but in tests the balance allows for more.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Be aware that tests which are &ldquo;non-local&rdquo; are far more difficult to maintain, and make a conscious effort to find ways to reduce the problem.</p>
