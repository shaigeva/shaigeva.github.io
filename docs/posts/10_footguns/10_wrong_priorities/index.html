This mini-post is part of a series about good testing practices, which I also presented at a couple of conferences.

In this blog post series, we saw a bunch of different practices, and talked about how they will affect us by changing
the properties of our tests:

Strength - how well they catch bugs
Maintainability - how easy it is to work with them
Performance - how fast they run

The bug funnel is all about performance.

This mini-post is part of a <a href="/posts/10_footguns/ten_footguns" target="_blank">series</a> about good testing practices, which I also presented at a couple of conferences.
<br>
Here it is in <a href="https://youtu.be/Ub31Ae6S1BY?t=1511" target="_blank">PyCon US 2023</a>
</span>

<p>In this blog post series, we saw a bunch of different practices, and talked about how they will affect us by changing
the properties of our tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strength - how well they catch bugs</li>
<li>Maintainability - how easy it is to work with them</li>
<li>Performance - how fast they run</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/posts/10_footguns/09_slow_tests/#the-feedback-loop-and-the-bug-funnel">The bug funnel</a> is all about performance.<br>
<a href="/posts/10_footguns/07_improper_test_scope/">Testing a cohesive whole</a> (implementation vs behavior) is about maintainability and strength.</p>
<h1 id="priorities-are-counter-intuitive">Priorities are counter-intuitive<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#priorities-are-counter-intuitive">#</a></h1>
<p>But how do we prioritize what we want to invest in?</p>
<p>First and foremost - the objective of tests is their strength.<br>
We have tests so that they catch bugs.</p>
<p>The unintuitive thing is that this is not what we should prioritize when we work:<br>
Start with making them maintainable, Then make sure they are fast enough
And then make them strong.</p>
<h1 id="why">Why?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why">#</a></h1>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.<br>
Slow tests are weak, or at least they are EVENTUALLY weak.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that, as a team, we decided that we are not willing to have tests that run for more than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>If, at some point the tests reach 30 minutes&hellip;<br>
It becomes very difficult to add more tests.<br>
So after enough time, there will be a lot of code that&rsquo;s not tested well.</p>
<p><img alt="Slow tests are weak" loading="lazy" src="/10_footguns/10_footguns_slow_tests_are_weak.png"></p>
<p>And the same thing happens with maintenance.<br>
It&rsquo;s more subtle, but if tests are not maintainable, it costs more to have them, and we end up creating fewer tests.<br>
So again, they will be eventually weak.</p>
<p>And, maintainability issues can also make it difficult to handle performance.<br>
An example we saw is test isolation and parallelization.</p>
<p>In other words:<br>
Maintainability is a necessary condition for performance, and both are necessary conditions for strength.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h1>
<p>So make maintainability the priority.<br>
<a href="/posts/10_footguns/06_testing_too_many_things/">Testing a single fact</a>, <a href="/posts/10_footguns/08_test_doubles_everywhere/#code-design">code design</a> and all the other practices we covered.</p>
<p>When you have a choice to make - I suggest to go with the most maintainable option almost always.<br>
Even at the cost of other things.<br>
Because in the long run, that&rsquo;s how we get tests that let us move fast, and have confidence in our code.</p>
